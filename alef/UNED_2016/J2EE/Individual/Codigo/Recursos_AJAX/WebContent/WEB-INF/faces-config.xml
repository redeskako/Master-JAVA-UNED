  <!--  Empty for now. There are many uses for faces-config.xml, but
        the most common are navigation rules (instead of having
        the return value of the "action" method be the base filename),
        bean declarations (instead of using @ManagedBean), and
        properties files (aka resource bundles).
        
        If you are not using faces-config.xml, it is perfectly legal
        to omit the file entirely. But, most people prefer to have
        a blank one already in their project for later use. -->
